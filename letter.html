                <p>Ladies &amp; Gentlemen,</p>

                <p>I wanted to write to you to state my intentions for the Sutro Society. We have come together to discuss why Sutro Baths was never rebuilt. There are many reasons that are negative, but I want to move forward by focusing on the positive.</p>

                <p>The principles I want to communicate are:</p>
                <ul class="letter-principles">
                    <li>The beauty of building physical things for your own community.</li>
                    <li>Investing in spaces for people to gather can change the future.</li>
                    <li>Shaping physical space changes your relationship with reality.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I believe Adolf Sutro embodied all of this. He made his wealth by building the best tunnels for the miners of California. He navigated enormous physical resistance from the ground to build a shaft that was filled with clean air and clear escapes for the miners who needed to get out.</p>

                <p>He accumulated enormous tracts of land in San Francisco and began building. He created Cliff House, Sutro Heights Park, the railroad on the north side of the city, and, of course, Sutro Baths.</p>

                <p>What I love about the way Adolf lived is that he constantly reinvested. Every time he had spare capital, he expanded his businesses and his community investments aggressively. The sheer force of will required to create an ethereal glass bathhouse in a saltwater-ridden pit is hard to fathom.</p>

                <p>We can build beautiful things for others.</p>

                <p>The other important aspect of his life that is worth consideration: spending money where you live is moral. The Bay Area is dripping in sanctimonious Giving Pledges from so-called Effective Altruists who believe that mosquito nets and shrimp farms are the top callings for those with means.</p>

                <p>I believe EA has done enormous damage to our society.</p>

                <p>Sending money to Africa to be wasted by non-profits is not a good use of capital. Investing directly in your own community is.</p>

                <p>As technologists drive home prices to eye-watering levels, local San Franciscans are left out in the cold loathing our success. I think Adolf realized this. He knew that wealth was a responsibility and shared it directly with his own community.</p>

                <p>He reinvested in the place that gave him everything.</p>

                <p>That is what I would like to propose to the Sutro Society.</p>

                <p>If you have more than you will ever need, what do you do with the surplus? My pitch: build something beautiful in San Francisco.</p>

                <p>Start small, learn how it works, partner with others, then build something of your own. Use that capital to improve our city.</p>

                    <h2>On the second principle: Investing in spaces for people to gather can change the future.</h2>

                    <p>Where can you get away from a screen and see a man eye-to-eye? For me, that is inside a sauna and on the mat in martial arts studios. You cannot bring a phone into a proper sauna and you cannot wear one while fighting. You must engage with another person fully.</p>

                    <p>Spaces where we can escape our phones are sacred. Discussions had in a bathhouse are magical. They are elevated by the contrast of the hot and the cold. I have had many ideas while submerged in a frigid cold plunge. Priorities have been reshaped in the furnace of a good sauna.</p>

                    <p>Giving people a physical state change is what can nudge them toward a mental shift. It is a gift you can give anyone. Just take them to a lake so you can both jump in together. It always helps. In cities, people rarely have access to tranquil natural experiences. So we must craft man-made environments to give people access.</p>

                    <p>I believe these spaces can change how people think which, in turn, can change how the future unfolds.</p>

                    <h2>On the third principle: Shaping physical space changes your relationship with reality.</h2>

                    <p>We stop playing with Lego. We put down the hammer and saw. We do not build fires. It is atrophying our understanding of ourselves.</p>

                    <p>When you whittle your own spear, build your own hut, put together your own robot, or renovate a room in your home, you make it yours.</p>

                    <p>A lot of the people I meet in technology are disembodied from reality. The last physical thing they built was a simple set of drawers from Ikea. Re-engaging with making things with one's hands is an incredible experience.</p>

                    <p>You get to make something that reflects your thinking.</p>

                    <p>I would encourage all the members of the Sutro Society to try making something they want. A simple object, tool, or item they will love. It will change you. It will change your relationship with reality.</p>

                <section class="letter-section">
                    <p>In summary, I hope that the Sutro Society will encourage the community of people in digital technology to spend more time in physical reality. We should invest our capital in teams who can make things happen in the real world. Then we must learn from them. Do not just send money, spend time. Go make things yourself. The world is molded by people who do this: you can do it too.</p>
